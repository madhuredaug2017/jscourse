1) html form (default behavior)--> pre ajax days how we used to send data 
2) validations
3) plugins and libraries
4) Templates

2005 (Microsoft ) XMLHTTPRequest --Ajax 
there is no ajax before 2005 
we have been using internet, saving the data what user has typed 

yahoomail 
//signup 

//get the data 
//save the data 
//server side html pre processing

//how to send data using get 
Query String: ?name=bob
            &
             age=40
            &
              city=portland
            &
            btnSave=

            //url 

 //get can be used for fetching(getting) the data 
    but it can also be used to send (save/update) the data 

 vs post 
 
 //1) you can send limited data in queryString 
 //can only send 255 chars 
 //2) security, post is more secure than get 

 // enterprise (organization) -- security is very important 
 //hack the data 

ajax -- network  
http -- any network 
network 
(client) request -- headers and body 
//get there is request body 
//data is sent in the url
(server) response -- headers and body

-----------
network request 
-----------------
url
method : 'get','post','put','patch','delete','options'
request -- headers and body
response -- headers and body

//url in the browser's address input bar // it automatically does a get request

1kb - 1024 bytes 
request -- headers 
response --
 headers -- sever (bytes), meta information (additonal information to help the browser)
 body -- html(content)

//GET

query string == url will be modified 
url : url?key1=value1&key2=value2
//get (unsecure data) 

//network router
//network sniffing --> router I can observer (owner )
//router password 
//all routers common password 
//
//news hack (equifax)

//post 
//they cannot see the post data 
//request body is sent over, but if it is https (encrypted and sent over)

https vs http (http over ssl (secure socket layer))
encryption --decipher text (garble the text)
install ssl certificates 
private key (unlock) and public key (lock)
ssl --rsa
it is not hacked yet  (very rarely)
10/15 --ssl - more secure 
//I write my own encryption (dont believe that guy)
//complex -- open source

//pre 2005/2008

//get data before ajax

//server to preprocess and return a new html
