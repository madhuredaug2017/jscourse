//House (building software is analogous to houses)

  //renovate 

  //buying a pre-developed software like erp tools
  //SAP, Oracle Applications, Microsoft Dynamics
  //customize 
  //complex (lot of money)--

//2)Buy a land and construct brick by brick 
// shape of the house is , mould what ever way you what 
//anything can happen
//it can collapse (torando,hurriance)
//we are not using any foudation
//no body can manage it (maintain it for longer time)


//3)Buy a land and lay foundation (pillars or frames) -- construct walls 
//shape of the house is determined by foundation

//using frameworks 
//Angularjs -- frames -- build your walls allong the frames 
//following the frames or follow the framework rules 
//confines or restricts to build along the rules 
//foundation -- your house is stronger but 
//you have to follow the rules of the frames (foundation)
//different framework

//Angularjs, bootstrap, backbonejs, vuejs, (React+redux/mobx)
//spinejs, emberjs,
