Agile Methodology

What is Agile?
The ability to create and respond to change in order to succeed in an uncertain and turbulent environment. (https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)

Scrum, like all of the agile processes, is both iterative and incremental. (https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/agile-needs-to-be-both-iterative-and-incremental)

Scrum comes from rugby 

1)Backlog items are “formless.” An item can be anything is very open and elegant in its lack of constraints. At the same time, the very formless nature of a backlog item often produces anxiety when a person hears that it can be anything.
2)Sprint Planning sets “driving directions.”
3) Sprint Demo is “product that is ready to ship.”
4) Retrospection as “learning from history.”


Scrum Roles

1)Product Owner is “the driver.”
2)ScrumMaster is “the doctor.”
